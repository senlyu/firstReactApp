# My first create App

## introduction?
### A simple project to create d3 bar chart with reactJS
##### 1.Input date validation
This app could check whether the input data is already inside the dataset and whether the input value is valid.
##### 2.Select bar react directly
This app could highlight the bar your mouse move over
##### 3.Simple Bootstrap design
This app use Bootstrap components for easy design
##### 4.stateless components
It is a pity, I dont have time to learn redux and try it here. Though, I try to do stateless components in this app. Most of the state saved in root. Only input value is temporary saved in input component. 

## how to use?
Just like use normal app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
